# Summary

**Boeing 747 model.**

This is a 1/100th* scale model of a Boeing 747-800I. Every parts can easily be printed without support on a standard 3d printer (200x200x200mm).</p>


A list of the parts needed is available in the "Thing files" section.


</p>
***Disclaimer :*** I Tried my best to be as precise as possible. *However,* some liberties have been taken when necessary and unavoidable (for the belly and engine mounts, for example). Thanks for your understanding.


</p>
*Can be printed larger or smaller, of course.

# Print Settings

Printer: Discovery 200
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: .2 mm
Infill: 33% or less

Notes: 
Minimizing material use while keeping the model strong and rigid is the aim.

# Post-Printing

## After Printing :

I recommend glueing every pieces together using super glue. 

Also use 155mm long M4 rods to support the wings to the fuselage.
